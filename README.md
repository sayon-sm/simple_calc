# Unconventional calculator

###### This site asks for a number before the page loads. That becomes the **1st operand**.

###### After loading, the **2nd operand** must be typed in the input field, followed by clicking **operator button**.

###### The **operation performed** & the **result** are displayed below.

###### The **Result** becomes the **1st operand** for the **next operation**.

## This is my practice project to learn

- JavaScript ES6 (let, const, template literals)
- Functions and control flow (if-else, function declarations)
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Array operations and data management
- Debugging and logging
- Type conversion (parseInt)
- Function binding and context
- Code organization and modularity
